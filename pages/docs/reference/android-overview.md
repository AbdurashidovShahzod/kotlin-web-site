# Using Kotlin for Android Development

Kotlin is the preferred language for developing Android applications since 2019. Choosing it as the language for 
Android development, you can benefit from:

* **Less code combined with great readability**. Spend less time on writing your code and understanding code of others.
* **Mature language & environment**. Kotlin has been developed since 2011 and it's seemlessly integrated in Android Studio.
* **Interoperability with Java**. You can use Kotlin along with Java in your applications without a need to 
migrate all your code to Kotlin.
* **Support of multiplatform development**. You can use Kotlin for developing not only Android but also iOS, backend, and web applications. 
Enjoy benefits of sharing the common code among the platforms.
* **Code safety**. Less code and better readability lead to less errors, which are easily detected by the Kotlin compiler. 
* **Easy learning**. Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.
* **Big community**. Kotlin has great support and much contribution from the community growing all over the world.
